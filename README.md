# File Sharing System

## Overview

The **File Sharing System** is a Django-based web application that allows users to upload, share, and manage files securely. It provides essential features such as user authentication, file management, and secure file sharing. The system ensures that users can easily store files and share them with others via unique, time-limited links.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload files of different types (e.g., documents, images, videos).
- **File Management**: Users can manage their uploaded files (view, delete, etc.).
- **File Sharing**: Users can generate unique, shareable links to allow others to download files.
- **Secure Download Links**: Links are time-limited for added security.
- **File Preview**: Users can preview certain file types (images, PDFs, etc.).
- **Admin Panel**: Django's built-in admin panel for managing users and files.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python Web Framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Basic UI)
- **Database**: SQLite (default for development)
- **Authentication**: Djangoâ€™s built-in user authentication system

python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up the admin credentials.

### Run the Development Server

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
